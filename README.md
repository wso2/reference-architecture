# Emerging Reference Architectural Patterns

![ra banner](/media/ra-banner.png)

A proven approach to helping every development organization become an integration agile organization. The Reference Architecture for Agility is a technology neutral logical architecture based on a disaggregated cloud-based model. It can be applied in incremental stages to create an integration agile foundation for any digital enterprises - deployable in private, public or hybrid cloud environments.

+ ### [Cell-based Architecture (CBA)](reference-architecture-cell-based.md) - *Decentralized, Cloud native, Microservice compliant* 
  
  Functional capabilities grouped in an architecture unit based on scope and ownership. It is decentralized where data moves within and across cells and governance are transparently applied through a control plane embedded within cells.

+ ### [Layered and Segmented Architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-architecture-layered-segmented.md) -  *API-centric centralized architectures*

  The focus of the enterprises moved to API-driven with the digital transformation became the strategy. As a result, the business and the technical architecture moved from service-orientation to API-centric. The primary focus of this specification is to look at the architecture approaches taken by the industry and represent those patterns as generic reference architectures. We identified two reference architectures, layered and segmented which we will be discussing in detail in this paper.

  * __Segmented Reference Architecture__: Functional capabilities sub-grouped within layers based on organizational ownership. It is a centralized system where data flow moves from layer to layer.
  
  * __Layered Reference Architecture__: Functional capabilities grouped in layers by following a System of Systems view. It is a centralized system where data moves from layer to layer.
